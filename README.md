# ARchitect
iOS Club Spring 2025 Project

## Basic Navigation
To help you navigate the project directory, the app's general navigation flow is described as follows: Opening the app, you will see **_MainView_** first, in which a sheet will be presented first to display **_AuthenticationView_**. Once authenticated you will be prompted to the actual content of _MainView_, which is a **_TabView_** that allows you to switch to either **_ARFurnitureView_** or **_ARFeedView_**. 

The directory currently has 2 important folders:
-   **View**: contains all frontend-related files 
-   **Model**: contains all data-modeling files

- For **AR Furniture team**, as of Feb 4, you should focus on developing in:
  - the views under **View/ARFurniture/**
 
- For **AR Social Media team**, as of Feb 4, you shoud focus on developing in:
  - the views under **View/ARMedia/**

Feel free to create more files as you develop
